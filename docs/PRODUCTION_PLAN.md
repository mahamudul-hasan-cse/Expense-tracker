# Production Plan — Wallet Agent

Status legend: `[x]` done and verified · `[~]` done but not fully verified (see notes) · `[ ]` not started

## Current state (inspected 2026-10-25)

- **Backend:** FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic (uv). Routers: categories, expenses, recurring, stats, export, budgets. `GET /health` exists but doesn't check the DB. CORS reads `CORS_ORIGINS` from env (comma-separated). No auth, no user model, no tests, no lint/type config, no logging setup.
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14.2.3 (vulnerable) + React Query + shadcn/ui + Recharts. Pages: marketing `/`, `/dashboard`, `/expenses`, `/settings`. Already has skeletons, toasts, delete confirmations, and a dark-mode toggle (next-themes, system default). No ESLint/Prettier config, no tests, no `public/` (no favicon/manifest), no 404 page.
- **Infra:** `docker-compose.yml` runs Postgres only. No Dockerfiles, no CI.
- **Repo:** **not a git repository.** Per-phase commits need either `git init` here or a clone of the original GitHub repo (decision needed — see Open questions).
- **Docker:** not running on this machine. **Workaround used for verification:** a throwaway local Postgres 16.2 from the `pgserver` Python package (run from the scratchpad and not a project dependency). Migrations, the smoke tests and pytest ran against it. Docker Compose itself is still unverified.

## Open questions (need your decision)

1. ~~Git~~: decided, `git init` here.
2. ~~Auth approach~~: decided, self-built JWT; existing rows go to a first owner user.
3. **Hosting** for backend + database (Phase 8).
4. **License** (Phase 9) — suggested MIT.

## Phase 0 — Verify current state and security fix
- [x] Migrations from zero, then smoke-tested against Postgres 16 (pgserver, not Docker): create/list budget (spent 400, 40%), deleting a category in use gives 400 with a clear message, expense create/edit (clearing the note works, 3-decimal amount gives 422), recurring create, due-today shows days_until 0, switching to weekly with due_day>7 gives 400, pause removes it from upcoming, rename and duplicate rename gives 400, stats return numbers, CSV export works. Not yet run through `docker-compose`.
- [x] Upgrade Next.js 14.2.3 → 14.2.35 (latest 14.2.x)
- [x] `npm audit fix` (non-breaking) applied: 9 → 6 findings. Remaining (each needs a major upgrade, so needs your approval):
  - `next` (critical): advisories with no 14.x fix (image optimizer DoS, RSC deserialization DoS, rewrite request smuggling, image cache growth). Fix is Next 16.
  - `postcss` (high): the copy bundled inside `next@14` (8.4.31). Fixed by upgrading Next.
  - `postcss-selector-parser`, `postcss-nested`, `tailwindcss`, `tailwindcss-animate` (moderate): via Tailwind 3, no non-breaking fix; Tailwind 4 is a major upgrade. Build-time only, not shipped to browsers.
- [x] `tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` pass on 14.2.35

## Phase 1 — Finish missing features
*Verified: `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, backend import, schema validation. **Not run against Postgres or clicked through in a browser** (Docker down).*
- [~] Category editing: `PUT /categories/{id}` (name + icon, trimmed, case-insensitive uniqueness excluding itself) and an Edit button and dialog in Settings. Names are globally unique until Phase 2 makes them per-user. No color column exists, so none was added.
- [~] "+ Add new category…" option in the expense form dropdown opens an inline name and icon row; the new category is selected automatically
- [~] Active/Paused toggle on each recurring item in Settings (`aria-pressed`). Paused items are dimmed. The backend already excludes inactive items from `/stats/upcoming-recurring`.
- [x] Cache invalidation audit: category rename now also refreshes expenses, stats, budgets, recurring and upcoming. Expense changes refresh expenses, stats and budgets. Recurring changes refresh recurring and upcoming. Budget changes refresh budgets and budget summary. Category create/delete refreshes categories (delete only succeeds when the category is unused).

## Phase 2 — Authentication and data isolation (ASK FIRST)
*Verified: 23 pytest tests against Postgres, migration upgrade/downgrade/re-upgrade on a DB with existing data, `alembic check` (no model/migration drift), the CORS + cookie flow over HTTP with curl, `tsc`, `npm run build`. **Not verified: the login UI in a real browser.***
- [x] Chose self-built JWT
- [x] `users` table + migration `b7d4e8f1a2c3` adding `user_id` (FK, CASCADE, indexed) to all four tables. Existing rows were assigned to an owner account (`OWNER_EMAIL`, optional `OWNER_PASSWORD`); without a password the owner can't log in until `uv run python -m app.cli set-password <email>`. Checked on real data: every row got the single owner id.
- [x] Category names unique per user and case-insensitive (`uq_categories_user_name`). Budget uniqueness stays `(category_id, month, year)`, which is already per-user because categories are. The 4 default categories are seeded for each new user.
- [x] Register / login / logout / refresh / me. Argon2 hashing, 15-minute access JWT, 30-day refresh JWT in an httpOnly cookie scoped to `/api/v1/auth`. Logout bumps `token_version`, which revokes every token. `SECRET_KEY` comes from env; production refuses the dev default.
- [x] All 19 data endpoints require a Bearer token and filter by `user_id`. Tests prove another user gets 401 or 404 and can't read, edit, delete or reference the first user's data.
- [~] Frontend: `/login` and `/register`, `RequireAuth` guard on the app pages, token sent with every call, one silent refresh on 401, then redirect to `/login?reason=expired`. Logout button in the navbar. CSV export now uses an authed fetch. Builds, but not clicked through in a browser.
- **Deploy note:** the deployed frontend must be redeployed with this version, or it will get 401s everywhere.

## Phase 3 — Backend hardening
- [ ] CORS from env (`ALLOWED_ORIGINS`); reject `*` when `APP_ENV=production`
- [ ] slowapi rate limiting; stricter on auth routes
- [ ] `/health` checks DB connectivity
- [ ] Uniform error body `{ "error": { "code", "message", "details" } }`; no stack traces in production. **Note:** the frontend reads `detail` today, so it will be updated to match
- [ ] Structured (JSON) logging, `LOG_LEVEL` from env
- [ ] `APP_ENV` switch; fail fast on missing required vars (e.g. `SECRET_KEY` in production)
- [ ] Indexes on `user_id` (+ composite with date) via migration. Date and category indexes already exist
- [ ] Pagination: expenses already paginated. Categories, recurring and budgets are small per-user lists, so they get optional `limit/offset` params with backward-compatible defaults

## Phase 4 — Tests
- [ ] Backend pytest against a separate Postgres test DB (models use Postgres UUID, so SQLite is not an option). Coverage target 80%+
- [ ] Frontend Vitest + RTL: date helpers (Asia/Dhaka, before 6 AM), currency, filters, form validation
- [ ] Playwright E2E: login → add expense → dashboard; create budget; filter expenses
- [ ] One-command scripts for each suite, documented

## Phase 5 — Code quality and CI
- [ ] ruff (lint + format), mypy; fix findings
- [ ] ESLint (`next/core-web-vitals`) + Prettier; fix findings
- [ ] pre-commit (ruff, prettier, eslint)
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with a Postgres service; cached deps; README badge
- [ ] Dependabot (npm, uv/pip, github-actions)

## Phase 6 — UX polish
Partially present: skeletons, toasts, delete confirmations, dark mode.
- [ ] Error states with retry; empty states with CTA
- [ ] One `Intl.NumberFormat('en-BD', { style: 'currency', currency: 'BDT' })` helper everywhere
- [ ] Mobile nav at 375px (current navbar overflows)
- [ ] Accessibility pass (labels, focus, aria, contrast)
- [ ] Inline validation matching backend rules; keep input on failure (submit already disabled while saving in the expense form only)
- [ ] PWA manifest + original icons + theme color
- [ ] Per-page titles/meta, favicon, custom 404

## Phase 7 — Monitoring
- [ ] Sentry backend + frontend, enabled only when `SENTRY_DSN` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is set
- [ ] README section on UptimeRobot against `/health`

## Phase 8 — Docker and deployment (ASK FIRST about hosting)
- [ ] Backend multi-stage Dockerfile (uv, non-root); frontend Dockerfile (`output: 'standalone'` is already set)
- [ ] docker-compose: Postgres + backend + frontend with healthchecks
- [ ] Migrations on start (entrypoint)
- [ ] Host-specific config + `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` (after your choice)

## Phase 9 — Documentation
- [ ] README rewrite (Mermaid architecture, env tables, tests, badge, screenshot list)
- [ ] `docs/API.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE` (after your choice)

## Phase 10 — Final review
- [ ] Clean-state run of everything (fresh DB, migrations from zero, all suites, builds, compose up)
- [ ] Secret scan (repo + history), auth on every endpoint, CORS and rate limits on, `npm audit`, `pip-audit`
- [ ] Final report + suggested next features (not built)

## Doesn't apply / adjusted
- "Change color" when editing categories: there's no color column. Icon (emoji) editing is supported; adding color is an optional extra.
- "Unique per user" category names: depends on Phase 2.
- Dark mode toggle that follows system preference: already implemented. Will only be checked.
- `expense-spec.md` routes `/` to the dashboard, but the code serves a marketing page at `/`. Keeping the code's behaviour.
